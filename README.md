# 🫁 Early Detection of Lung Cancer Using Deep Learning and Machine Learning

Lung cancer is often detected in its advanced stages, making early diagnosis critical 🛑. I developed a **Deep Learning** and **Machine Learning** algorithm 🤖 to help identify lung cancer signs in histopathological images 🖼️.

By applying **fuzzification**, the algorithm provides detailed insights into cancer progression 🔬. This system aids healthcare professionals 👩‍⚕️👨‍⚕️ in assessing disease severity and prioritizing treatment 🚑.

Early detection can lead to better outcomes, potentially saving lives 💡❤️. My project aims to empower healthcare providers with timely interventions ⏳, contributing to a future where lung cancer is more manageable 🌟.
